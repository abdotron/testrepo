the code works in the following manner it  gets the positions of signs and the positions of the agents then gets the agents that passed the sign position at a certain time slot. then it calculates the direction to be plotted on the sign by checking the next sign the same agent crossed by at a larger time slot. the system then records the directions and timeslots of the signs in a certain file and starts a process at which the time is calculated and the sign direction is plotted.

The initial conditions of each sign is taken from the stored data by plotting the first direction to be plotted n each sign.
if a certain sign is missing direction then it plots the last plotted direction.
the positions of agents is claculated within a certain range that could be added to the code at the first run.
the agents must cross a certain sign to plot its direction. the signs cannot plot directions that aren't existing by the agents.


the data is very large so the time stamps, the positions, the frame and id of agents that passed the interesting positions only (the signs positions) is stored in a smaller version of the data and extracted to file named data_scrampled.csv
